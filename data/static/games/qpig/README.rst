Quantum Piggy Farm
------------------

``qpig`` demonstrates a simple incremental game. Items in the shop are priced in
``MicroCerts`` (1/1000 of a Certainty point) which slowly recharge over time.
Feeding veggies can temporarily double production and some veggies might grant a
bonus ``QP`` when chewed.
